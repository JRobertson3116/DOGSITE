    <p>Here you will read some of my fun facts about Dogs.</p>
    <h2>What I know</h2>
    <p>
      Dogs can have all diffrent types of persinalities, for instance one of my
      bigger dogs is a lazy goofball and my smaller husky is quiet yet
      energetic! <br> Dogs like to chase and play with toys. One of my dogs favorite
      toys is a sock. <br> Dogs love to play with people and other dogs. <br>And last but
      not least I think dogs are one of the most popular pets on the planet.
